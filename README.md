## About

Employee Summary application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. As a user, you can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. Once all the team members are logged, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
